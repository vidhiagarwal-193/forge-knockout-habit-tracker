# MESA Forge — Habit Tracker

A Next.js app: type a habit, it's added to a "Today" list, tap to mark it done for today. No server, no login — everything lives in `localStorage` in your browser.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Deployable to Vercel with zero configuration.

## Notes

- Data is stored per-browser via `localStorage` under the key `habit-tracker:habits`. Clearing site data or switching browsers/devices loses your habits.
- No accounts — anyone using the same browser profile shares the same habit list.
